# FLOAT X: Smart Classroom Management System

## Project Information

- Project ID: SIH1625
- Theme: Smart Automation
- Title: Smart Classroom Management System to Enhance Education

## Proposed Solution / Project Idea

We are developing a Smart Classroom Management System to enhance education with the following features:

### Key Features

- Smart Attendance System
- Interactive Learning
- Safety and Security
- Resource Management
- Data Analytics

---

### 1.Smart Attendance System

Smart Attendance System automates the process of taking attendance, offering multiple options like facial recognition, fingerprint sensors, and more. While such technologies exist, they are often expensive for smaller institutions.

We are developing a solution that allows teachers to use their mobile phone cameras to take attendance, making the system more accessible and cost-effective. The system will also offer manual control for teachers who wish to take attendance traditionally.

#### Alternative Solution (GPS-Based Attendance System)

We also considered a GPS-based system where students can mark their attendance using their smartphones. If a student is within the campus, the attendance is registered. To prevent proxy attendance, the system will check student locations multiple times during a lecture. Teachers will have manual control to handle any issues.

### 2. Interactive Learning

We aim to create a student community similar to social media but specific to their institution. This platform will allow students to interact, ask and answer questions, and collaborate. Additionally, the platform will host educational games, quizzes, and events to engage students further.

### 3. Safety and Security

We are implementing anonymous reporting systems for students and women, allowing them to report issues directly to higher authorities. To maintain accountability, each report will be associated with a student ID (without revealing the identity). However, in case of serious incidents, the studentâ€™s identity can be revealed if necessary.

### 4. Resource Management

We are building a central resource management system that allows institutions to manage computing devices and other resources from a single location.

---

### 5. Data Analytics

Our data analytics system will provide student profiles displaying their attendance, assignments, and performance. The system will also offer personalized suggestions for improvement and track various metrics like marks and credit scores.
